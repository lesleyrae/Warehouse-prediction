# Warehouse-prediction

## Task Description
The Operations team needs to staff locations appropriately to efficiently fulfill orders and keep
our customers happy.
You are provided a subset of order data for some initial model building aimed at forecasting orders
for each of the next 14 days. The plan is to present this model to another data scientist on your
team and your manager. The main goal is to present your basic model and make recommendations
for future improvements. Your recommendations for future work could consider both increasing
model complexity and using additional data.
